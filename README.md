# NK 2021
This repository contains scripts used to analyse and plot our NK TIL data.


While complete reproducibility for this project is not achived, we attempt to make the data process
and analysis more transparent by making the scripts open for everyone.

You are able to find the Seurat Analysis and the custom scripts used to plot the figures and
perform downstream analyses.
